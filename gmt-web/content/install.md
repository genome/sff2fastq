## Download
The installation process currently consists of a very simple Makefile.

Just do the following:

<pre class="terminal">
    git clone git://github.com/genome/sff2fastq.git;
    cd sff2fastq;
    make;
</pre>

The 'sff2fastq' executable should be in the working directory.
Afterwards, you can move the executable to wherever you wish. Usually,
this is the directory `/usr/local/bin` .
