The installation process currently consists of a very simple Makefile.

Just do the following:

  git clone git://github.com/indraniel/sff2fastq.git;
  cd sff2fastq;
  make; 

The 'sff2fastq' executable should be in the working directory.
Afterwards, you can move the executable to wherever you wish. Usually,
this is the directory `/usr/local/bin` .
